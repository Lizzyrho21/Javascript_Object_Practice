# Javascript_Objact_Practice
I've always had a hard time with understand and using JS objects to my advantage. Maybe this will help!

**Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties. One way to create an object is by using braces as an expression.**


**An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.**

**We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.**
EX:
object name {
    key: value
}

example:

below is a cool example of a small object
it really only has a boolean value and an array,
but objects can have an infinite amount of values inside them.

let day1 = {
squirrel: false, // a boolean value
events: ['work', 'touched tree', 'pizza', 'running']}; // an array of values



}
